# Portfolio of Evidence â€“ Tech Skills

This is my Portfolio of Evidence (PoE) for the technological skills I've developed. I built this site using a free HTML template, which I customized to reflect my own content and design preferences.

## About the Project

The website includes sections for my skills, projects, and experience. Itâ€™s a simple, clean way to show what Iâ€™ve learned and what I can do.

## What I Learned

One of the biggest takeaways from this project was learning how to use Git. I used it for version control and to upload my website from my local machine to GitHub.

Things I did with Git:
- Set up a local Git repository
- Made commits as I worked
- Connected to a remote repo on GitHub
- Pushed the project online

## Hosting

The site is live thanks to GitHub Pages, which made it easy to publish.
