							<p> Below is a data cleaning project. My process in terms of cleaning the data includes the following: removing of duplicates,standardizing data types,deleting useless records with too many nulls and blanks too the point where no valueable insights can be made from them,removing useless columns.</p>

						<h2>Internet of things projects</h2>
						<p>Greenhouse Climate Monitoring Project at the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) Bien Donne Farm! 

							Together with my team, we designed and implemented a sophisticated system that monitors critical greenhouse conditions like temperature, humidity, COâ‚‚ levels, light intensity, and dust levels. This project not only optimized plant growth but also tackled the challenges farmers face in ensuring stable, healthy environments for their crops.
							
							Key Takeaways from the Project:
							Sensor Integration: Installed and configured multiple sensors for real-time environmental monitoring.
							
							Data-Driven Decisions: Enabled precise control over greenhouse conditions to prevent issues like frost and heat stress.
							
							User-Centric Design: Focused on creating an intuitive, easy-to-use interface for farmers to access and act on data.
							
							Collaboration: Worked closely with data management and end-user teams to ensure seamless integration and meaningful insights.</p>

						<h2><b>Chatbot project (design thinking methodology)</b></h2>
						<p> My team and I created a medical chatbot and applying design thinking principles to solve a health care related problem that was 
							identified by a nursing staff member from UWC using a chatbot, which was the communication barrier between patients 
							and medical practitioners due to the fact that they speak different languages making it difficult for medical information to related
							 to child development to be communicated to patients I am pleased to announce the launch of MommyWhisperer, which is a revolutionary 
							 chatbot designed by our talented team. We created this chatbot to make it easier for mothers and caretakers 
							 to gain medically verified information about child development in the language which they are most comfortable in, 
							 you can interact with bot in English, isiXhosa and Afrikaans by selecting the button associated with that particular language 
							 and we believe this will empower families to give their children 
							the best possible start to life while also bridging the gap caused by medical practitioners and 
							patients speaking different languages..</p>

							In IFS 231 I learnt in a business we use business analysis for the following reasons; to understand the structure
							 and dynamics of a business, it allows you to understand current problems in the target organization, it helps you to 
							 identify improvement potentials and recommend solutions to enable an organization to achieve goals, it helps you to identify 
							and articulate the need for change and to maximize the value delivered by an organization to its stakeholders. </p>

					<p> My second project management project was a community-based project, created as part of the MAN325 module at the 
						University of the Western Cape, addresses period poverty by installing sanitary pad dispensers in girlsâ€™ bathrooms at 
						Excelsior Secondary School in Belhar, Cape Town. The project promotes menstrual hygiene, reduces school absenteeism, and 
						fosters gender equality in education. We used fundamental processes such as initiating, planning, executing, monitoring 
						and controlling, and closing, as articulated in PMBOKâ€™s process groups and knowledge areas.
